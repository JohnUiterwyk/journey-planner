# Journey Planner

## Project Requirements
- User must be able to create an account and log in
- When logged in, user can see, edit and delete trips he entered
- Implement at least two roles with different permission levels (ie: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on his owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, an admin would be able to CRUD on all records and users, etc.)
- When a trip is entered, it has Destination, StartDate, EndDate, Comment
- When displayed, each entry has also day count to trip start (only for future trips)
- User can filter trips
- Print travel plan for next month
- REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you donâ€™t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
- All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile app, disregard this)
- In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
- Bonus: unit and e2e tests!
- You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
